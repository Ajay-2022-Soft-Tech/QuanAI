# Assistant App using OpenAI and DALL-E APIs

![App Demo](demo.gif)

This repository contains an assistant app that integrates OpenAI's API for natural language processing and DALL-E's API for image generation. The app is designed to assist users with various tasks including text-based queries and image creation.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes OpenAI's powerful API to understand and respond to user queries.
- **Image Generation**: Integrates DALL-E's API to generate images based on text descriptions provided by the user.
